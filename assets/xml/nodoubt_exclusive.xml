        <p begin="00:00:13.633" end="00:00:15.766">We were just trying to make <br/>a great record</p>
        <p begin="00:00:15.766" end="00:00:19.033">that had all of the inspirations <br/>that we love</p>
        <p begin="00:00:19.033" end="00:00:21.933">and just be really modern, <br/>where we&#39;re at right now.</p>
        <p begin="00:00:21.933" end="00:00:25.833">&#45; When we were inspired, <br/>we knew we were on to something.</p>

        <p begin="00:00:39.633" end="00:00:42.400">and being able to do, like, <br/>a little mini video</p>
        <p begin="00:00:42.400" end="00:00:45.000">to go with a song that we love <br/>called &quot;One More Summer&quot;</p>
        <p begin="00:00:45.000" end="00:00:47.133">has been really exciting.</p>
